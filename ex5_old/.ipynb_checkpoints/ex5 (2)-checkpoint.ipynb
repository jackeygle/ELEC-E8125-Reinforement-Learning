    "In this exercise, we will implement the REINFORCE policy gradient algorithm for [InvertedPendulum environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/inverted_pendulum/). The InvertedPendulum is similar to the previously used CartPole environment, except it has a continuous action space: the action can now have values in a range of [−3,3]. The action value represents a numerical force applied to the cart, with magnitude representing the amount of force and sign representing the direction.\n",

    "This code is designed to establish a neural network policy where the variance is constant. The `PolicyFixedVar` class, which is a subclass of `nn.Module`, defines this policy. The policy uses a neural network to map states to actions, outputting a normal distribution with a mean and a standard deviation. \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Create and Return Distribution:**\n",
    "   - In the `forward` method, create a Normal distribution (`probs`) with the computed `action_mean` and `action_std`. This distribution represents the policy’s output given a state input."
